What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","   - Functions is a block of reusuable code that perform a specific task and can be called from anywhere. It can be defined and independent.\n","   - Method is a function that is associated with a object or a class. It operates on an instance of that class.\n","\n","  Function example:\n","\n","                  def greet(name):\n","                    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","                  print(greet(\"Alice\"))  #Calling a function\n","\n","  Method example:\n","\n","                 class Person:\n","                 def __init__(self, name):\n","                      self.name = name\n","                 def greet(self):\n","                   return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n","\n","             p = Person(\"Bob\")\n","             print(p.greet())  #Calling a method on an object\n","\n","#2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","   - Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.\n","   - Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.\n","\n","   Function definition with parameters example:\n","             def add(a, b):\n","             return a + b\n","\n","   Function call with arguments example:\n","             result = add(5, 3)  #5 and 3 are arguments passed to the parameters 'a' and 'b'\n","                   print(result)  # Output: 8\n","\n","#3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","   - In Python, you can define a function using the def keyword, and call it by specifying its name. The lambda keyword is also used to define an anonymous function.\n","\n","   Standard function example:\n","              def multiply(x, y):\n","              return x * y\n","              print(multiply(2, 3))  # Output: 6\n","\n","  Lambda function example:\n","              square = lambda x: x * x\n","              print(square(4))  # Output: 16\n","\n","#4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n","   - The return statement used in Python function to ends a function and sends the value back to the caller. It's used to return the result of a function's operations.\n","\n","   Example:\n","              def add(a, b):\n","                 return a + b\n","                result = add(10, 20)\n","              print(result)    #Output: 30\n","\n","#5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","   - An Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over. It has an __iter__() method that returns an iterator.\n","   - An Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object (that is iterable). It has a __next__() method that returns the next item.\n","   - We can generate an iterator when we pass the object to the iter() method.\n","\n","   Iterable example:\n","              numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","              for num in numbers:\n","              print(num)  # 1, 2, 3 are retrieved one by one\n","\n","  Iterator example:\n","              it = iter(numbers)\n","              print(next(it))  # Output: 1\n","              print(next(it))  # Output: 2\n","\n","#6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","   -  A generator is a special type of an iterator that generates values once at a time by using the yield keyword. It is more memory-efficient than using lists, because it generates values lazily.\n","\n","   Example:\n","              def count_up_to(limit):\n","              count = 1\n","              while count <= limit:\n","              yield count  # Generates the next value in the sequence\n","              count += 1\n","\n","              gen = count_up_to(3)\n","              print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n","              print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n","              print(next(gen))  # Output: 3\n","\n","#7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","   - Generators have several advantages over regular functions, including memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, and flexibility.\n","\n","   1. Memory efficiency: Generators yields stores one value at a time, so they do not need to store the entire sequence in memory.\n","   2. Performance: Generators are usually faster when dealing with large datasets because they compute values on-the-fly.\n","\n","   Example: Instead of generating a large list of numbers that takes up memory, a generator will only compute the next number when needed.\n","   \n","                     def large_range():\n","                        num = 0\n","                     while num < 1000000:\n","                     yield num\n","                     num += 1\n","\n","                    gen = large_range()\n","                    print(next(gen))  # Output: 0\n","\n","#8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","   - A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that is defined by using the lambda keyword. It is typically used for short, one-off operations where you we don't need a full function. They're often used for simple mathematical calculations and data transformations.\n","\n","   Lambda function to add two numbers example:\n","                add = lambda x, y: x + y\n","                print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n","\n","  Lambda used with `map()`example:\n","                numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","                squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n","                print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n","\n","#9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","   - Map in Python is a function that works as an iterator to return a result after applying a function to every item of an iterable (tuple, lists, etc.). It is also used when we want to apply a single transformation function to all the iterable elements.\n","\n","   Example:\n","                 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","                 squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n","                 print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n","\n","#10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","  - Map: This function takes a list of numbers and return with each number squared in a new list.\n","  - Filter: This function creates a new list of only even numbers from a list of integers.\n","  - Reduce: Reduce applies computation via a function to a list and return a results. It takes an iterator and returns a single result which is different than map which returns an interator too.\n","\n","  Map() example:\n","                    numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","                    squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n","                    print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n","\n","  Filter() example:\n","                    evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n","                    print(list(evens))  # Output: [2]\n","\n","  Reduce() example:\n","                    total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n","                    print(total)  # Output: 6"],"metadata":{"id":"SjPGbJwbrDZ7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
